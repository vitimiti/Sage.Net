# The Recreation of the SAGE Engine in Modern Dotnet

This document is here to document my process to recreate the SAGE engine as published by
[EA on their official GitHub](https://github.com/electronicarts/CnC_Generals_Zero_Hour).

The objective is to create a full system without the use of external libraries. While libraries
like the ones in [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET) and the ones in [Veldrid](https://github.com/veldrid/veldrid)
would speed up the process, and projects like [OpenSAGE](https://github.com/OpenSAGE) already exist,
this is meant for my personal development of programming skills in dotnet, forcing me to better understand
graphics programming and the development of low level systems in dotnet, such as marshalling and p/invoke.
